Batch searching/logging in Google news in Japanese

This program loads a list of search keywords from a text file, searches for each keyword in Google News in Japanese and registers the number of search results into another text file. 

For the list of search keywords, we use the names of member states of United Nations and their capitals [1].

Note that this program is adapted from GoogleSearch suite of Sakthithasan Sripirakas [2], which is an update to the library of Anthony Hseb to run Python 3.x execution environments [3].
